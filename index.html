      <h2>Why would justin water my plants? I can water my own plants.</h2>
      <p>Sure, you could. But you're rich. You can pay others to do work for you. So you should. That's what keeps the economy going, and it frees up more time to do whatever it is that made you so damn rich in the first place.</p>

    <div class="flex-card-element">
      <h2>Okay, but why Justin?</h2>
      <p>Allegedly, Justin knows a bit about plants. He's kept a few alive in his day. He knows which ones need more sun than others. He knows when to water them. And most important of all, he is a white male, so he needs your support to survive in New York.</p>
