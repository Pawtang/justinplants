            <span id="hilight">Many people want</span> the peace and beauty that plants bring, but are not able to keep them alive. Plant owners become frustrated as their green friends die, overwhelmed by the possible reasons their plant died: Was it too much water? Too little? Is their pot too small? No intuitive or friendly resource exists to turn their thumb green, so for people who have more care for their plants than time, the Plant Man is the answer to their problem.
